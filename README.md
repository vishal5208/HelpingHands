# What it does

Helping Hands is a project which allows users to ask for donations by giving proper description to prove that they are really in need. People can view the list of all the people in need, read their descriptions, upvote or downvote them with a sound comment that why or why not should here be money donated. They can highlight points from description that can indicate the listing to be a scam. Donors can review each listing, judge description, its up to them to consider upvotes or downvotes if they want to. They can then donate "eth" directly to the listing to the wallet addresses they found in need through the listing or to wallet addresses that they know of.

This project uses decentralized approach as there is no central body monitoring the listed needs and there is no such thing as being banned on this platform. Instead of a central body which may have different views than donors, approving what to be listed and which user to be banned, there are the donors who are going to judge by themselves that where should they donate money and what seems a scam.
